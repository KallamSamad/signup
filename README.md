# Sign up Form for a website
## Overview
I created a basic form which uses validation tools such as only accepting emails that have an @ symbol in the email field.
I also applied FlexBox to create a dynamically styled page. I used position: relative and position: absolute and know to use
psotion absolute to put it front of another image which is the nearest ancestor.
